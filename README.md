I am a front-end developer with a design background, currently focusing on frontend development and combining a dual focus on how things work and how they feel. I build interfaces using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React that perform reliably and communicate clearly. Responsible and proactive, I move fast while listening and iterating. I thrive on precision, even in chaotic environmentsâ€”as long as thereâ€™s purpose behind it. Problem-solving, especially uncovering hidden challenges, drives me. In my work, I actively apply artificial intelligence to enhance solutions. I stay curious and take ownership to create solutions that make senseâ€”and hopefully a difference.
