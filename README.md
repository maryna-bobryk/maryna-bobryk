I am a front-end developer with a design background, currently focused on frontend development and how things work and feel. I build interfaces with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React that perform reliably and communicate clearly. Responsible and proactive, I move fast while listening and iterating. I thrive on precision, even in chaotic environmentsâ€”as long as thereâ€™s purpose behind it. Problem-solving, especially uncovering hidden challenges, drives me. I actively apply artificial intelligence in my work. Curious and accountable, I create solutions that make senseâ€”and hopefully a difference.
